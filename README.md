# Graded_Remapping

Python code to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript "Graded Remapping of Hippocampal Ensembles under Sensory Conflicts"

The data can be found at: https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping

The dataset can be downloaded from a terminal with `git clone https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping.git`

All code was verified to work in Python 3.8.1 and 3.7.3. Make sure to change the path near the beginning of each script to your local path where you saved the data.

We recommend using Anaconda to manage virtual environments: https://www.anaconda.com/

After installing Python, you can run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in a terminal to install all the dependencies.
