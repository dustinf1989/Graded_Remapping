# Graded_Remapping

This repository contains Python code to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript [_Graded Remapping of Hippocampal Ensembles under Sensory Conflicts_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109661).

The [dataset](https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping) can be downloaded from a terminal with 
```
git clone https://gin.g-node.org/dfetterhoff/Graded_Remapping.git
```

All code was verified to work in Python 3.8.1 and 3.7.3. Make sure to change the path near the beginning of each script to your local path where you saved the data.
